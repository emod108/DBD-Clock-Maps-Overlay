This program allows you to overlay Dead by Daylight clock maps over any other desktop application.
After choosing a map you can set its position, size and opacity.
You also are able to use any other image. PNGs with transparent parts are also supported.

Known issues:
1) Image may not show up if you play in fullscreen mode. For this you should use windowed fullscreen or windowed modes.
2) May not work if you have multiple screens.
